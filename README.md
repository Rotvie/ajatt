# All Japanese All The Time (AJATT)
## What is AJATT?
AJATT is a language learning approach that encourages full immersion in Japanese. It involves surrounding yourself with the language in everyday life, sentence mining for effective vocabulary acquisition, and using timeboxing for focused study periods. Customizable to individual needs, AJATT commonly uses resources like Anki flashcards, Japanese media, and books.

## My tools
### Anki 
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a popular and powerful spaced repetition software (SRS) designed to help users with efficient learning. It allows you to create and manage flashcards on various subjects, enabling the reinforcement of memory through regular and strategically timed reviews.

Here are some of the Anki Addons I use: 
- [AJT Flexible Grading](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1715096333)
- [AJT Pitch Accent](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1225470483)
- [AJT Furigana](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1344485230)
- [Review Heatmap](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1771074083)
- [Paste Images As WebP](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1151815987)
- [Edit Field During Review Cloze](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/385888438)

### MPV Media Player

[MPV](https://mpv.io/) is a powerful, open-source media player appreciated for its cross-platform capabilities, customization, and scripting options. With its light design and wide compatibility with various media formats, it is a favored choice for many.

One of the notable features of MPV is its seamless integration with [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), an enhanced fork of youtube-dl. This integration allows users to directly stream videos from platforms like YouTube as well as download content.

For language learning, MPV's scripting capacity is a valuable asset. By incorporating Lua scripts, you can tailor MPV to boost your learning experience with additional functionalities. The `mpv` folder in this repository includes the Lua scripts that I utilize for this purpose.

### Dictionaries
Learning Japanese becomes significantly easier with the help of dictionaries, especially JP-JP ones.

#### qolibri EPWING dictionary viewer
Use [qolibri](https://github.com/ludios/qolibri) to search multiple dictionaries simultaneously. It requires dictionaries in EPWING format.
Here are some downloadable EPWING dictionaries for qolibri:
- [Japanese_Dictionaries](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/ldyklp3362pgg/Japanese_Dictionaries)
- [NHK_Pitch_Accent](https://www.mediafire.com/file/sxmpse8n92c9oxg/NHKACT.zip)



### Miscellaneous Tools
In addition to dictionaries, some other tools can enhance your Japanese learning experience. Here are some of them:
- [Textractor](https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor): A handy tool for extracting text from Visual Novels. This can help improve your reading comprehension skills
- [VPNGate](https://www.vpngate.net/en/download.aspx): A VPN service that allows you to unlock Japanese content, broadening your exposure to authentic language use
- [subs2cia](https://github.com/dxing97/subs2cia): Allows you to condense the audio from videos to increase passive immersion density
