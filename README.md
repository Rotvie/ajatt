### Anki

### Dictionaries
Learning Japanese becomes significantly easier with the help of dictionaries, especially JP-JP ones.

#### qolibri EPWING dictionary viewer
Use [qolibri](https://github.com/ludios/qolibri) to search multiple dictionaries simultaneously. It requires dictionaries in EPWING format.
Here are some downloadable EPWING dictionaries for qolibri:
- JP-JP Dictionaries: [Japanese_Dictionaries](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/ldyklp3362pgg/Japanese_Dictionaries)
- NHK Pitch Accent Dictionaries: [NHK_Pitch_Accent](https://www.mediafire.com/file/sxmpse8n92c9oxg/NHKACT.zip)

### Miscellaneous Tools
In addition to dictionaries, some other tools can enhance your Japanese learning experience. Here are some of them:
